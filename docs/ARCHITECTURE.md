# Prompt Engineering Playground Architecture

## System Overview
The Prompt Engineering Playground is designed as a modular, extensible toolkit for exploring and analyzing prompt engineering techniques.

## Component Architecture

### 1. Source Code (`src/`)
- `__init__.py`: Package initialization
- `prompt_playground.py`: Core implementation of prompt techniques
- `streamlit_app.py`: Interactive web interface

### 2. Core Components

#### Prompt Playground
- Implements various prompt engineering techniques
- Supports multiple model interactions
- Provides comprehensive output analysis

#### Streamlit Interface
- Interactive web application
- Real-time prompt technique demonstration
- Dynamic result visualization

### 3. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for end-to-end functionality
- Comprehensive coverage of prompt techniques

## Data Flow
```
User Input -> Prompt Techniques -> Model Interaction -> Output Analysis -> Visualization
```

## Extension Points
